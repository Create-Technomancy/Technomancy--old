<h1 align="center">Create: Technomancy  <br>
 </h1>
Technomancy, is a mod about using magical energy to advance science. Whither through souls, magical feilds, or stellar wind is erelivant only progress matters. Some may call it "mad science" but its for progress. When traditional science hasw failed you look for alternatives, collect souls or shadows to make your coffee maker run. Power your high tech laser weaponry with oil, made from trapped creatures possibly still alive, the sky is the limit until we find our way around that at least.
Technomancy employs magic as an altenative to most things technical. With create lacking in technology its the job of technomancy to add more to the table by whatever mad science themed methods nissasary.
