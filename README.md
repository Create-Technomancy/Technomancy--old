<h1 align="center">Create: Technomancy  <br>
 </h1>
Technomancy, is a mod about using magical energy to advance science. Whether through souls, magical fields, or stellar wind is irrelevant only progress matters. Some may call it "mad science" but it's for progress. When traditional science has failed you look for alternatives, collect souls or shadows to make your coffee maker run. Power your high tech laser weaponry with oil, made from trapped creatures possibly still alive, the sky's the limit until we find our way around that at least.
Technomancy employs magic as an alternative to most things technical. With The Create Mod lacking in technology it's the job of technomancy to add more to the table by whatever methods necessary.
